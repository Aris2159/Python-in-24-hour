# Operators can be used with strings in Python for various purposes such as concatenation, repetition, and slicing.
# Here are some examples of how operators work with strings:
# There are arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators

# Arithmetic Operators

#Addition Operator
#srting
string= "Hello" 
string2 = " World"
print(string + string2) # Concatenation operator for strings\
#number
num1 = 2
num2 = 3
print(num1 + num2) # Addition operator for numbers

# Subtraction Operator
# Strings do not support subtraction, so this will raise an error if attempted.
# It only supports numbers
